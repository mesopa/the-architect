# The Architect Website Prototype

In a mixed environment, where multiple invasions, revolutions, war and world leaders mutual agreements for openness to the world. The architecture varies, from traditional, that is progressively being lost, to western influences. The concrete replaces the trees every day and the old ones fight to compete with the futuristic skyscrapers.

Walking thru the old roads, it's' the best way to find this diamonds, from the Bund to Nanjing Road, passing through Baoshan Road and ended up in Lujiazui Financial Area.
